The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed
six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy
S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular
velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.

The sensor time domain signals, accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ, were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width
sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap at a constant rate of 50Hz (128 readings/window).
For each record it is provided the activity label and an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain using the
accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ, measured in g, and tGyro-XYZ, measure in radians per second. These
time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a
median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.
Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and 
tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.  Subsequently, the body linear
acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also
the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, 
tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).  Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals
producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to 
indicate frequency domain signals). These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

From this set of variables the meanvalue and the standard deviation were estimated for each activity and each subject: 

+ mean(): Mean value
+ std(): Standard deviation
